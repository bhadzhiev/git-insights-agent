- Uses conventional commit format in 7/7 commits

**Personalized Recommendations:**
1. Based on the provided developer statistics, here are 3 personalized recommendations to help improve their coding practices and career development:
2. Diversify your commit types: While it's great that you use conventional commit formats, try to incorporate more diverse commit types beyond just 'chore' and 'feature'. This will showcase your breadth of skills and contributions.
3. Explore merge requests: Consider submitting more merge requests to collaborate with your team and gain experience with the review process. This can help you develop stronger communication and integration skills.
4. Expand your code ownership: Your top files indicate a focus on infrastructure-related tasks. Seek opportunities to work on a wider range of components or domains to broaden your technical expertise and demonstrate your versatility.

**Senior Developer Code Review Insights:**

### File: infrastructure/lib/constructs/ec2-manage-state/index.ts

**Naming Conventions**:
- The code generally follows consistent naming conventions, using camelCase for variables and functions.
- The class name `Ec2ManageState` is clear and descriptive.

**Design Patterns**:
- The code appears to be using the Construct pattern from the AWS CDK library, which is a common and appropriate design pattern for this use case.
- The use of the Step Functions state machine to manage the EC2 and SAP instance states is a good example of applying the State pattern.

**Complexity Levels**:
- The `Ec2ManageState` class has a significant amount of logic, with multiple state machine definitions and various tasks. This complexity is understandable given the nature of the problem being solved.
- The use of conditional logic and nested tasks within the state machines is well-structured and does not appear to be overly complex.

**Formatting and Style**:
- The code is well-formatted, with consistent indentation, spacing, and brace placement.
- Line breaks and whitespace are used appropriately to improve readability.

**Comments and Documentation**:
- The code includes some high-level comments to explain the purpose of different sections, which is helpful.
- However, there is a lack of detailed inline comments or docstrings to explain the specific purpose and functionality of each component.

Overall, this file appears to be in good condition, with a well-designed and structured implementation. The main area for improvement would be to add more comprehensive documentation and comments to enhance the maintainability and understanding of the codebase.

### File: .codecatalyst/workflows/sap-cdk-deploy-prod.yaml

**Naming Conventions**:
- The file and action names follow a consistent naming convention, using descriptive and clear names.

**Design Patterns**:
- The use of a YAML-based workflow configuration is a common and appropriate design pattern for managing CI/CD pipelines.
- The separation of different stack deployments into individual actions follows a modular and reusable approach.

**Complexity Levels**:
- The workflow configuration is relatively complex, with multiple stack deployments and dependencies between them.
- However, the complexity is justified by the nature of the deployment process and the need to manage the dependencies between the different AWS resources.

**Formatting and Style**:
- The YAML file is well-formatted, with proper indentation and spacing.
- The structure of the file is clear and easy to read.

**Comments and Documentation**:
- The file includes some comments to explain the purpose of the workflow, which is helpful.
- However, there is a lack of detailed documentation or explanations for the specific configuration settings and dependencies.

Overall, this file appears to be in good condition, with a well-designed and structured workflow configuration. The main area for improvement would be to add more comprehensive documentation and comments to enhance the understanding and maintainability of the deployment process.
