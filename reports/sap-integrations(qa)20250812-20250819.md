**Senior Developer Code Review Insights:**

### File: handlers/lupp/improved-packaging/src/error-handler.ts

**Naming Conventions**: The code follows consistent naming conventions, using camelCase for variables and methods, and PascalCase for classes and interfaces. The naming is clear and meaningful, adhering to established patterns.

**Design Patterns**: The code uses the Factory pattern to create specialized error handlers, which is a good design choice for maintaining flexibility and extensibility. The `ErrorHandler` class acts as a facade, delegating error handling to the appropriate specialized handlers.

**Complexity Levels**: The methods in the `ErrorHandler` class are generally of reasonable length and complexity. The code avoids deep nesting of control structures, maintaining good readability and testability.

**Formatting and Style**: The code follows a consistent formatting style, with proper indentation, line breaks, and spacing. Brace placement is consistent throughout the file.

#### Organizational Trends

Here is an analysis of the provided weekly aggregated development data:

1. Development Velocity Trends:
   - The data shows that in the 33rd week of 2025, there was a total of 3 pull requests (PRs) merged across the 'sap-integrations-qa' repository.
   - This indicates a relatively low development velocity, as 3 PRs in a week is a relatively small number for a typical software development team.

2. Team Productivity Patterns:
   - The median lead time (time from PR creation to merge) for the PRs is 24 hours, which suggests a reasonably efficient PR review and merge process.
   - However, the 75th percentile lead time is also 24 hours, indicating that a significant portion of PRs are taking a full day or more to merge. This could be a sign of potential
